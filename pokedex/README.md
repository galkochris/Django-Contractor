Welcome to the World of Pokemon!

This is a Pokemon <()()> isn't it adorable?

While I have you here is you very own Pokedex! We've made some changes, so now you and all the other researchers can add you findings! 
https://galkopokedex.herokuapp.com/

Be wary, however, wild bug pokemon have been seen climbing around in there, me and the other professors will be working on fixing that,
but in the meantime, be sure to use the pokedex to store your findings!

This Very Simiple and Very Similar formatted App, tests my ability to take a pre-existing concept and modify it into something else. 

I have attempted to take the same concepts of wiki and account and modify them into pokemon and account. Where Pokemon houses information of a specific pokemon and can display all or one Pokemon depending on the view. Account attempts to employ the same concepts as Django standard user tools, such as sign in, sign up, etc.

The More interations I have done of these concepts the more I understand them, and enjoy making them. This app represents my own work, with insipration from other sources, but every change, edit, and addition were soley my own. I hope my two apps, multiple tests, modular views and templated based interface are satisfactory to show my above beginner level understanding of Django.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and enjoy!

Pokedex: General usability of the app, very similar to makewiki
Pokemon: Module elements of inputs, allowing users to create their own pokemon entries


*known issues: Admin superusers cannot be created due to a currently unknown settings issue;
