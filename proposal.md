For my project I intend to create a website that combines both aspect from BEW and SPD 1.2 to impliment a type of Gen 8 Pokemon pokedex.

this is useful for people who want to see all the data for the new Pokemon in a creative and easy to use format, with search capabilities and the ability to moderate add and fix content as a community.
